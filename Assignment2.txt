Assignment 2
============

Concepts:

o Information theory
o Source Coding
o Channel coding

Take arbitrarily LARGE text data (atleast 64 KB). 

a) Find the list of unique symbols and their probability
of occurence. Compute the entropy.

b) Source code the data using Huffmann Coding/Shannon Fano Code  - (use a binary tree to compute the Huffman code). Generate a codebook from the Huffman code.

c) Divide the data into fixed length packets. Channel encode the packet.

d) Assume that the bit error rate is p. Generate bit-errors appropriately
in each packet.

e) Send across the channel using the UDP-client server programs provided.

f) Recover the text from the received data.  If the data is in error (check
whether the CRC computed matches with what is transmitted), request
for a retransmission of the packet.

Minimum expected:  Source code (any algorithm), generate bit errors, packetise, transmit, decode -- will be given 50% of the marks.
